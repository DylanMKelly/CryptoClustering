# Module 19 Assignment
This assignment demonstrates Python and unsupervised learning to predict cryptocurrencies fluctuation over periods of time

## Overview
Within the Crypto_Clustering.ipynb the following  tasks are outlined
   - Preperation of data for manipulation
   - Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
   - Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data
   - Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
   - Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
   - Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data

# Resources
The following are resources and links used to help with the creation of these scripts
  - Class recordings and posted answers to previous homework were used to help determine paths toward solutions
  - Homework from Module 19 and Crypto_Clustering_starter_code.ipynb were used in the development of code 

## Additional Help 
TA assistances after class provided assistance for inquiries and hiccups in code
